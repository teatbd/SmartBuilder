# SmartBuilder

**SmartBuilder** is a Python-based tool that allows developers to build, simulate, and generate smart contracts written in languages like Solidity or Rust using a declarative and friendly syntax. It's designed as a high-level, educational, and productive interface to facilitate both learning and multichain prototyping.

---

## 🚀 What does SmartBuilder do?

- Enables building smart contracts from Python.
- Generates equivalent code in Solidity (and soon in Rust, Ink!, and others).
- Helps understand and abstract the structure of contracts across multiple blockchains.
- Envisioned as a backend engine for no-code platforms, IDEs, or educational tools.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simplify the creation, understanding, and generation of multichain smart contracts, allowing Python developers and educators to access the blockchain world without prior knowledge of Solidity, Rust, or similar languages.

## 📚 Quick Example
```python
from smartbuilder import Contract, StateVar, Mapping, Function

contract = Contract("SimpleStorage")
contract.add_state_variable(StateVar("storedData", "uint"))

get_function = Function("get")
get_function.set_return("uint")
get_function.set_code(["return storedData;"])
contract.add_function(get_function)

print(contract.compile())
```

**Solidity Output:**
```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Support for arrays
- [ ] Support for enums
- [ ] Comments in generated code
- [ ] Function attributes (`view`, `pure`, `payable`)
- [ ] Rust (Ink!) code generation
- [ ] Modular backend structure
- [ ] Visual web interface (no-code mode)
- [ ] Export-ready for Remix, Hardhat, Anchor, etc.

## 🔍 Other Use Cases

### 🧱 Rapid Prototyping
Use SmartBuilder to sketch contracts without writing low-level code. Ideal for:
- Hackathons
- Web3 MVPs
- Logic testing and agile design

### 🛠️ Technical Documentation
Document contracts from Python, enabling:
- Readable logic presentation
- Explaining contracts to non-technical teams
- Generating examples for documentation or training

### 🔁 Reusable Contract Templates
Build a library of common and customizable contracts. Useful for:
- No-code/low-code platforms
- DAO, NFT, or DeFi protocol creators
- Web3 legal firms and auditors

## 🧬 Future Vision and Potential

SmartBuilder aims to become the universal declarative interface to define smart contracts that can then be compiled into multiple blockchain languages. At maturity, it could be:

- A backend engine for IDEs, no-code tools, or AI assistants.
- An educational standard to teach smart contract logic without language barriers.
- A library used by developers who want to separate design from implementation.
- A valuable tool for Web3 startups and legal firms that need scalable contract generation.

SmartBuilder could apply to grants from Web3 foundations (Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana) or evolve into an open-source project with both community and commercial interest.
